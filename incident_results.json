The replication lag exceeds the threshold, and long-running queries are detected on the replica, suggesting that the issue could worsen if not addressed quickly. Given the peak-hours window, I would not want to be woken up for this incident at this time unless it were more critical. However, since there is no revenue impact, I can tolerate waiting until business hours without major consequences. To balance urgency with team wellbeing, I will send an alert to the on-call engineer via PagerDuty during work hours and create a tracking ticket in JIRA to ensure timely attention while avoiding unnecessary disruptions to the team."
