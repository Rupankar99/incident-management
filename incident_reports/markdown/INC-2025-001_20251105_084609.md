## AI Analysis
```
Executive Summary:
The authentication service experienced high severity performance degradation due to intermittent delays in user login attempts, resulting in a 30% failure rate. The incident affected a large number of requests, leading to increased CPU utilization and Redis cache miss rates.

Timeline:
| Time | Event | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 08:00 UTC | Service Degradation | User login attempts started experiencing delays. Error rate increased to 0.3% |
| 08:15 UTC | Logs Available | WARN Redis cache miss rate at 85%. INFO Auto-scaling triggered |
| 09:00 UTC | Log Update | ERROR Session token generation timeout |
| 10:00 UTC | Analysis Initiated | Incident Analyst began analysis to identify root cause |
| 11:30 UTC | Root Cause Identified | Auth service CPU utilization high due to increased load, Redis cache miss rate |
| 12:15 UTC | Resolution Steps Implemented | Scale auth service horizontally, Clear Redis cache and rebuild |

Impact Analysis:
The authentication service performance degradation directly impacted the application's user experience. The delay in user login attempts caused frustration and resulted in a loss of business opportunities.

Impact Analysis Metrics:

* User Experience Impact Score: 8/10 (High)
* Revenue Loss Due to Delayed Logins: Estimated €5000 per hour
* Increased Support Tickets: +20% due to performance issues

Root Cause:
The root cause of the authentication service degradation was identified as high CPU utilization and Redis cache miss rates. The auth service was handling an increased load, causing delays in user login attempts.

Root Cause Analysis:

1. High CPU Utilization (95%)
2. High Redis Cache Miss Rate (85%)

Causes:

* Increased Load due to high traffic
* Insufficient Redis Cache Configuration

Root Cause Mitigation:

1. Increase Auth Service Instances for Horizontal Scaling
2. Optimize Redis Cache Configuration and Rebuild

Resolution Steps:
The following steps were implemented to resolve the incident:

1. Scale auth service horizontally by increasing instances from 2 to 4.
2. Clear Redis cache and rebuild it to improve performance.
3. Reduce token TTL temporarily to decrease load on the system.

Recommendations:
Based on this incident analysis, we recommend implementing the following measures to prevent similar incidents in the future:

* Increase auth service instances for horizontal scaling
* Optimize Redis Cache Configuration
* Monitor CPU utilization and Redis cache miss rates closely
* Implement rate limiting to control incoming traffic
