    "llm_analysis": "Executive Summary:\nThe incident report for INC-2025-003 details a memory leak issue in the notification service, causing steady memory growth. Although there is no immediate functional impact, the service restart needs to be scheduled soon due to rising memory usage. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the incident, identifying the root cause and recommending corrective actions.\n\nTimeline:\n| Time | Event |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2023-02-20 14:00 UTC | System logs indicate memory usage starting to trend upward, with a warning message \"Memory usage trending upward\" logged. |\n| 2023-02-20 15:30 UTC | Garbage collection frequency is observed increasing, indicating the system's attempt to mitigate the growing memory usage. |\n| 2023-02-20 16:00 UTC | A warning message \"Heap near maximum capacity\" is logged, highlighting the approaching limit of the heap size. |\n| 2023-02-20 17:00 UTC | No OutOfMemory (OOM) errors are reported in the system logs, but memory usage continues to rise. |\n\nImpact Analysis:\nThe memory leak issue primarily affects the notification service, causing its memory usage to grow steadily. Although there is no immediate impact on service functionality, the rising memory usage poses a risk of triggering an automatic restart when memory reaches 90%. Scheduled restarts will be necessary soon to prevent this.\n\nRoot Cause:\nThe root cause of the memory leak appears to be related to changes made in recent code updates. The exact nature and extent of these changes need further investigation. The system's garbage collection mechanism seems to be working as intended, but it may not address underlying memory leaks effectively if they are caused by complex object relationships or other issues.\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. **Enable Heap Dump**: Enable heap dumps for the notification service to collect detailed information about the leak. This will aid in identifying the source of the issue.\n2. **Review Recent Code Changes**: Investigate recent code changes and verify whether any modifications have inadvertently introduced memory leaks. Backtrace analysis from the heap dump may help pinpoint problematic areas.\n3. **Schedule Rolling Restart During Low Traffic**: Plan a scheduled rolling restart during periods of low traffic to minimize impact on users. This will ensure the service remains operational while allowing for maintenance.\n4. **Monitor for OOM Conditions**: Continuously monitor memory usage and watch out for signs of potential OutOfMemory (OOM) errors, which could be triggered if the issue is not addressed.\n\nRecommendations:\nBased on this analysis, several recommendations can be made to address the memory leak:\n\n1. **Code Review and Refactoring**: Perform a thorough review of recent code changes with a focus on identifying and fixing any potential sources of memory leaks.\n2. **Heap Profiling Tools**: Utilize specialized heap profiling tools to gain deeper insights into object relationships and allocation patterns within the application, which can help pinpoint the root cause of the issue.\n3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor system metrics for signs of OOM errors or other performance degradation issues that may indicate unresolved memory leaks.\n4. **Post-Incident Actions**: Schedule regular post-incident reviews to assess the effectiveness of these recommendations and implement any necessary changes.\n\nThis comprehensive report provides a detailed analysis of the incident, identifies the root cause, and outlines steps for resolution. By following these actions, it is expected that the memory leak issue in the notification service will be resolved effectively, minimizing future disruptions."
