    "llm_analysis": "Executive Summary:\nThe API Rate Limiting - Partner Payment Service incident (INC-2025-002) affected 25% of checkout flows during peak hours in the eu-central-1 region. The root cause was determined to be the third-party payment provider's rate limiting, resulting in 1500 rate limit hits and a queue depth of 450.\n\nTimeline:\n| Time | Event | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 14:00 UTC | Incident Triggered | Partner API returned 429 Too Many Requests, indicating that the rate limit threshold had been reached. |\n| 14:05 UTC | Rate Limit Threshold Reached | [WARN] Rate limit threshold reached, indicating that the rate limit for API calls had been exceeded. |\n| 14:10 UTC | Queuing Failed Requests | [INFO] Queuing failed requests for retry, as the system attempted to mitigate the impact of the rate limiting. |\n| 14:15 UTC | Checkout Completion Time Increasing | [WARN] Checkout completion time increasing, indicating that the rate limiting was affecting the performance of the checkout service. |\n\nImpact Analysis:\nThe incident had a significant impact on the payment-integration service, resulting in a 25% decrease in successful checkout flows during peak hours. The increased queue depth and rate limit hits also led to an increase in checkout completion time, which affected customer experience.\n\nRoot Cause:\nThe root cause of the incident was determined to be the third-party payment provider's rate limiting of API calls. This resulted in 1500 rate limit hits and a queue depth of 450, leading to the mitigating measures being taken by the system.\n\nResolution Steps:\n1. Implement exponential backoff: The system will implement an exponential backoff mechanism to handle the rate limit hits, allowing for more efficient retrying of failed requests.\n2. Negotiate higher rate limits with partner: The payment-integration service will negotiate with the third-party payment provider to increase the rate limits for API calls, reducing the likelihood of rate limiting in the future.\n3. Enable request batching: The system will enable request batching, allowing multiple requests to be sent together and reducing the impact of rate limiting on the checkout process.\n4. Add fallback payment provider: A fallback payment provider will be added to the payment-integration service, providing an alternative option for checkout flows in case the primary provider's API is affected by rate limiting.\n\nRecommendations:\nBased on the analysis of the incident, we recommend:\n\n1. Implementing exponential backoff and request batching to improve the performance of the payment-integration service.\n2. Negotiating higher rate limits with the third-party payment provider to reduce the likelihood of rate limiting in the future.\n3. Adding a fallback payment provider to provide an alternative option for checkout flows.\n4. Monitoring the system's performance regularly to detect any potential issues related to rate limiting or other API-related issues.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, we can improve the reliability and performance of the payment-integration service, reducing the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future."
